# 3-body-problem
- A repo for 3 body simulations in Physics

For full disclosure, I started this by re-writing the jupyter notebooks created by [Luke Polson](https://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel/tree/main/Python%20Metaphysics%20Series).

I am practicing my python by converting them into full python files with inputs and outputs, as well as re-writing it in Julia.
