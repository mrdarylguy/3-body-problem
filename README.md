# 3-body-problem
- A repo for 3 body simulations in Physics

I started this by editting & re-writing the jupyter notebooks created by [Luke Polson](https://github.com/lukepolson/youtube_channel/tree/main/Python%20Metaphysics%20Series).

I am practicing my python by converting them into full python files with inputs and outputs, as well as re-writing it in Julia. 

There are currently (18/9/2021) 2 active versions.

- 3_body_no_input.py which is a rudimentary version, with variables hardcoded, and all equations fed to the solver for 1 single run.

- 3_body.py which is a more generalised version that extracts planetary input data from a given dictionary, and runs the solver for each planet's orbit around the sun.
